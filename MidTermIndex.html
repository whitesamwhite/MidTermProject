  Welcome to my Website
</h2>

  <p>
     I love the way my webpage turned out, I wanted to have a very functional website with my own artistic twist.  I wanted to make it look like a vintage webpage from the early 2000’s while using advanced techniques to compliment it.  The simplistic design can be easily modified and is incredibly easy to navigate.  The most interesting thing I found about this project was that at one point I could not stop messing with the design and transition.  I did not ever think that I could be so enamored by a project, but designing a webpage from scratch (beginners we worked on one webpage the whole time) is part speaking another language, part art project, and part puzzle.  I thoroughly enjoyed experimenting with this project and it has made me much more excited for the future of this class.
I used a very large array of sources in order to achieve the desired effects for my webpage.  On the Reddit page for CSS3, they have a massive list of sources that have answers to most of the questions I had.
The only real issue I have with the page is that I could not get the skeleton container to scroll underneath the nav bar.  I tried multiple techniques I found online with no success.  The skeleton layout probably caused me the most amount of trouble.  It might have been that it was overly intimidating because of its large amount of code, however while trying to mess with the photos on my page 1, I realized that I was better off not messing with it too much because it tends to shift around the entire page.
The moving background was quite a challenge due to having similar components as things I had already been using and had specific styles that I did not want.  I ended having to add extra ID’s to the different parts of the project.
</p>

<p>One way I would improve the project would be to have a more defined objective.  I would have loved to have received a faux client and have to design a website for them, with there specifics, not just “design something to show pictures.”  In the real world, if we are not designing websites for ourselves, we will be designing for someone else which I think is a key part of web design: visualizing what the client wants and putting yourself into their shoes.  I think all of the components of the project were challenging enough, I would just have liked to have more defined goal than just a finished website, I would just suggest making it more of a real life project.
